# 3DPrinting
A repository for 3D printing parts that fit Dagoma (c) D200 printer.

all parts are build from scratch and not based on Dagoma(C)

## Motivation
the target of that parts is to improve the rigidity of the original design.
all screw and rod size are design to match the one I’ve got. you can easily (more or less) modify them for other type of screw.

an other motivation is to test the excelent FreeCAD Software. everything is done with freecad, except the slicing and Gcode.... for th moment

## Bracket Sup
X Printer Axis is mainly improve by the Superior Bracket (BracketSup)
4 screws to lock the rods instead of 2 and better inertia on the part.

## Bracket Inf
this one is to insure the perpendicularity of the main frame in Y.
As my printer is always on the same wood panel, it is supposed to be directly screw in it.
the initial idea was to design a bracket connected to the frame, but thanks to the superior one it looks like it’s not needed.


##Position Locker
simple position locker to lock (of course) th position of the printer
